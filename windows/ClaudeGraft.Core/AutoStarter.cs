/// Keeps an opted-in account's five-hour window open without a press. This is the
/// one place the app starts a session that a person did not ask for, and the rest
/// of the app leans hard the other way — the button is the only other caller, and
/// the Mac build forbids a session on a timer outright — so it is drawn as narrow
/// as it can be, and pinned as the sole automated caller by StartCallerAuditTests.
///
/// It fires for a profile only when its owner turned this on, only when a *live*
/// reading says no window is open, and never twice inside the cooldown. That last
/// guard is the one that matters most: SessionStarter has never been proven to
/// open a window, and a start that quietly opens nothing leaves the window reading
/// closed for ever — so without the cooldown a broken start would re-fire on every
/// sweep, once for every account, for as long as the app ran.
///
/// So the cooldown is written to disk before the attempt, not held in memory. This
/// app has a startup crash to its name, and an in-memory cooldown would be empty on
/// every relaunch — a crash-loop, with the sweep firing seconds after each launch,
/// is exactly the "over and over" the rule exists to stop, and only a cooldown that
/// outlives the process holds it off.
///
/// Where the button stays enabled on an uncertain reading — greying out the one
/// useful action on a guess is worse than leaving it — the background does the
/// opposite: a reading that is missing, off disk, or refused says nothing about
/// whether a window is open, and starting a session on that guess is worse than
/// waiting for a reading that can answer. Uncertainty here is silence.
